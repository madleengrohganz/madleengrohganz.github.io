I apply geochemical methods to study the ecology of early vertebrates (mainly conodonts and thelodonts) and reconstruct climate and environment.

## The ecology of early vertebrates

### Reconstructing the feeding ecology of conodonts with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy

In this project I applied EDX to elucidate the feeding ecology of conodonts. We prepared polished thin sections of individual conodont elements (the earliest mineralised vertebrate dental tools), which reveal micron scale resolution of the internal growth structure and individual growth layers. My EDX analyses show differences in strontium content (an indicator for trophic level) across the growth layers in the conodont elements, which coincide with distinct growth stages and wear patterns. These findings indicate that conodonts might have assumed their mature feeding habit of predators or scavengers only after an initial larval stage characterized by a different, more passive feeding mode.

### Reconstructing diadromy in thelodonts

In this project I applied different geochemical methods, EDX, microprobe and LA-ICP-MS to shed light on the potential diadromy (movement between freshwater and marine environments) of thelodonts. I prepared polished thin sections of scales of different thelodont species, hypothesised to be fully marine and diadromous. These sections reveal micron scale resolution of the enamel and dentine growth layers in the scales. My geochemical analyses show differences in strontium content (an indicator for ambient salinity levels) between fully marine and potentially diadromous thelodonts. These findings indicate that diadromous behaviour might have been present in thelodonts.

## Climate and environmental reconstruction

### Reconstructing environmental changes during the MIS 3 (Last Glacial Maximum) 

Ravine slopes at the Nesseltalgraben site in southeastern Germany provide a unique last glacial sediment record for the Northern Calcareous Alps. In this project high-frequency proxy variations were detected in the Nesseltalgraben profile, that reflect interstadial-stadial climate variability covering the entire MIS 3. For this collaborative project I conducted EDX analyses to help clarify the origin of the carbonate-rich layers in the Nesseltalgraben profile as clastic rock flour.

### Reconstructing depositional rates and their effect on paleoenvironmental proxies

Variations in depositional rates affect the resolutions of proxies used for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. In this project we focused on the onset of the late Silurian Lau Carbon Isotope Excursion. We used the DAIME model to construct relative age models and apply these models to transform the δ13Ccarb values as well as concentrations of selected redox‐sensitive elements to account for changing depositional rates. For this collaborative project I conducted the bulk rock and trace element sample preparation and measurement as well as preliminary data analysis.

### Reconstructing short-term climate variability using red algae 

Coralline red algae contain records of past climate variability and are commonly used for palaeo-climate reconstructions in mid- to high-latitudes. In this project we investigated red algae from a temperate site in the Mediterranean Sea to assess their potential as an environmental recorder.
I conducted sclerochronological analyses to identify seasonal growth patterns and analysed Mg/Ca, Li/Ca, and Ba/Ca ratios (measured in the algal skeletons using LA-ICP-MS) and established their relationship with temperature.

### Reconstructing salinity of Pennsylvanian epicontinental seas

The Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA) was the longest-lived ice age of the Phanerozoic and a time of dynamic glaciation. The paleo-temperature and paleo-climate history of the LPIA is reconstructed based on δ18O records. However, a strong divergence can be observed in the Upper Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) δ18O conodont records from different epicontinental sea settings. Salinity changes due to freshwater input are hypothesized to cause the observed difference. I used LA-ICP-MS to analyse strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) and documented the influence of freshwater input on the δ18O signal in different epicontinental sea settings.
