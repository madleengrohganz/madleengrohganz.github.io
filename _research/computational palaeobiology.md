I apply computational palaeobiological methods to test hypotheses on early vertebrate evolution and the evolution of vertebrate key features. These projects are strongly linked to my PhD research on the evolutionary origin of teeth. I mainly focus on heterostracans, which are among the earliest vertebrates. This group plays an important role in testing early vertebrate evolutionary scenarios (e.g. testing hypotheses on increasingly active feeding strategies over time) and the evolution of teeth, a vertebrate key feature.

### Computational Fluid Dynamics analyses of heterostracan oral plate denticles

The feeding mode of heterostracans is highly contested with hypotheses ranging from suspension feeding to predation. In this project I investigated the role of the denticles on the heterostracan oral plates in feeding. The forward-facing orientation of these denticles has been hypothesised to be a specific adaption to suspension feeding. However, we were able to reject this hypothesis based on our CFD analyses of 2D denticle models. The denticles might instead have served to prevent material from lodging between the oral plates.

### Finite element and microstructural analyses of heterostracan oral plates

In this project I tested the mechanical function hypothesis of the heterostracan oral plates using FEA and microstructural analyses. Our FEA analyses reveal a relationship between simulated compressive stress and bone volume fraction (a proxy for internal microstructure). These results indicate an adaption of the oral plate skeletal microstructure to a mechanical function in which bone adaptively remodels under applied load to become denser to withstand increased stress. These findings support a mechanical function for the oral plates, such as deposit feeding or scavenging.

### Investigating the morphogenesis of heterostracan oral plates and denticles

In this project I investigate the morphogenesis of the heterostracan oral plates as well as the oral plate denticles. Based on high-resolution synchrotron scans, I devise a general model for oral plate growth, describe their histology and compare it to the histology of the heterostracan dermal skeleton. I also test hypotheses on the morphogenesis of the oral plate denticles and their potential homology with teeth.

### Range of Motion and Computational Fluid Dynamics analyses of a 3D heterostracan oral apparatus reconstruction

This project is based on the reconstruction of a 3D heterostracan oral plate apparatus, which I was previously involved in. I used this 3D model to investigate the range of motion of the oral plates. I determined their osteologically possible movement, i.e. simulated how far the oral apparatus was able to open. Based on the ROM results we can draw conclusions about the potential of a scavenging or predatory feeding mode. We also apply CFD analyses to 3D oral apparatus models with different viable opening angles determined by ROM to further test the suspension feeding hypothesis.
