I apply molecular genetics methods to study lampreys, the only living jawless vertebrates besides hagfish. The insights from my developmental studies add to my studies on fossils and allow me to gain a more holistic understanding of early vertebrate evolution and the evolution of teeth.

### Morphogenesis of lamprey 'teeth'

Based on histological sections work from several decades ago, lampreys have been hypothesised to replace their keratinous toothlike structures. We revisit this research area and use synchrotron scanning to characterise the internal structure and morphogenesis of lamprey 'teeth'. Our high-resolution 3D data of the 'teeth' of different lamprey species allows us to describe these structures in detail and draw conclusions about the prevalence of 'tooth' replacement in lampreys.

### Lamprey 'teeth' transcriptomics 

A core set of genes expressed during the formation of teeth has previously been identified (core dental network, Fraser et. al., 2009). However, this only applies to jawed vertebrates, but has never been tested in their jawless relatives. In this project I use transcriptomics and bioinformatics methods to identify which genes are preferentially expressed in the replacement 'teeth' of lampreys. I compare 'tooth' material from various life stages as well as different types of lamprey 'teeth' (from the tongue and the hood). The aim of this project is to contrast tooth genes in jawed and jawless vertebrates and potentially establish a deep homology of tooth structures in jawed and jawless vertebrates. I also plan to extend this project to include Immunohistochemistry to better understand the spatial aspect of gene expression in lamprey 'teeth'.
