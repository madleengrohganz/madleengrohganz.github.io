Welcome! I am a palaeobiologist applying computational methods, geochemistry and molecular biology to study the ecology and evolution of (early) jawless vertebrates.<br> 
I earned my B.Sc. in Geology and my M.Sc. in Palaeobiology from the [Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](https://www.gzn.nat.fau.eu/palaeontologie/) (Germany).<br> 
Currently, I am pursuing a PhD at the [Palaeobiology Research Group, University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/earthsciences/research/palaeobiology/) (UK), where I work on a project on the evolutionary origin of teeth. <br> 
My academic work has been [published](/publications) or is forthcoming in Proceedings of the Royal Society B and Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, among other outlets. <br> 
My [research](/research) explores the ecology and evolution of (early) jawless vertebrates using a broad variety of methods such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Analysis (FEA), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) and transcriptomics.<br> 
I am particularly interested in the field of evolutionary developmental biology combining insights from fossils and genetics to answer big questions about early vertebrate evolution.

I am currently looking for a postdoc position starting in autumn 2024. If you are interested in working with me, please get in touch, I am looking forward to hearing from you!
